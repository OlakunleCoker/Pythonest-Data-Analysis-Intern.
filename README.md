Churn Analysis and Retention Strategy Development (Project 1): This is a Telco's customer churn data to uncover trends and patterns driving customer attrition. 
I analyze demographic information, service usage and tenure to identify factors influencing churn. 
I was able to visualize using the likes of pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots. 
I was able to use my findings to develop targeted retention strategies aimed at reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.


Predictive Modeling for Customer Churn Prediction (Project 2): I was able to harness the power of machine learning to predict customer churn and 
build predictive models using algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Description (Project 3): I dive into EDA through descriptive statistics and visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots etc. 
I was able to understand the distribution of key variables like tenure, monthly charges, and total charges. 
By analyzing relationships between categorical variables and churn using bar plots and exploring correlations between numerical variables and churn.


Feature Engineering and Model Building (Project 4): Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets and Scale numerical features to ensure all variables are on the same scale. 
Select appropriate machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests. 
Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one. Interpret the model results
